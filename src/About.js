                    <h2>About</h2>

                    <p>Founded by two innovative individuals in the NFT space, namely @MrBlueChip and @Fungibledude who were fuelled by an insatiable need to see a fresh take on the current art, and concepts presently apparent in the NFT world.</p>

                    <p>An epic array of pixel and voxel art, created through the combined effort of four talented pixel, voxel and 3D artists, paired with a solid utility, and a sound vision.</p>

                    <p>We believe many facets make Neo-Anunnaki unique within its right as an NFT Project.</p>

                    <p>Loosely based around ancient Sumerian lore with a sci-fi twist, that is sure to appease the appetites of Sci-Fi buffs, Historians, and Conspiracy Theorists alike. This same concept runs congruently throughout the entire project from the lore, and artwork, down to all utility functions, personal Metaverse space, and of course, the Neo-Anunnaki future gaming platform.</p>

                    <p>While there is pixelated art, NFT projects out there with a similar vibe, Neo-Anunnakis’ art style stands out from the crowd and has its unique flavor to it. With many original traits not yet seen in other projects, paired with the high quality and attention to detail each art piece expresses, we feel it’s fair to say that this project is an eye-catcher, to say the least.</p>
            
                    <p>The collection is split into three factions. Each faction has its particular skin, which means three character types look different from each other within the same collection.</p>

                    <p>Each faction has a different rarity, with Reptileens, who are reptilian humanoids being the rarest, followed by the Promethianz who are humanoid Cyborgs, and then the Apelorianz who are genetically engineered human/ape hybrids.</p>
                
                    <p>We believe we may potentially have innovated a new and efficient way to reward early adopters and OG supporters. This is by enabling them to burn the utility token rewards they redeem, in exchange for a Neo-Nephelim in the following drop, which is the counterpart collection for the Neo-Anunnaki project.</p>
                
                    <p>Many projects are dropping their VX avatars and even have NFT’s with AR functionality, however, we believe we may also be partially innovating by dropping our VX spaceships as vehicles for our avatars in the metaverse. The unique part about this is that we are also dropping our VX Mecha avatars, so this project already has two different VX models to grace the Metaverse with!</p>

                    <p>Although being an NFT project with a DAO and fractionalized vault isn’t exactly unique at this stage of the game, we feel that these particular factors, combined with what you have read above, and that which you are about to read below in our whitepaper, can be constituted as something that’s within the realm of unique.</p>

                    <p>Not to mention that, due to launching on the Ethereum Blockchain, we may have a custom vault built to our specific requirements. We will keep our community updated in regards to this possibility.</p>
